## Abstract 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments implemented lockdowns to reduce the spread of infection through people, places and movement. Simultaneously, there was a sudden increase in the use of infectious disease models to inform policy responses. However, many of the models built for Lower- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) used data and assumptions derived from higher income contexts, partly due to an absence of data to inform localized models. Though lockdown measures undoubtedly reduced the scale of deaths worldwide, some had devastating socio-economic consequences. The World Bank estimated that as many as 150 million people fell into extreme poverty in 2021 following the pandemic.
In this context, this thesis set out to do three things. Firstly, to gather and analyse data on social contacts and mobility at multiple levels (individual, ward and district) in Zimbabwe. Primary household surveys, qualitative data and Call Data Records were collected, combined and analysed with census and global satellite datasets. With these data, the thesis has explored what socio-economic characteristics are associated with more contact, more movement and in what places. Secondly, it incorporates these data into a granular Agent Based Model (ABM) designed to reflect the Zimbabwean population. Thirdly, it uses an ABM to explore scenarios for more targeted movement restrictions that limit socio-economic harm while maximizing reduction in the spread of infection.
The scenario modelling finds some occupation-based restrictions to be more effective in mitigating disease spread, but has cautioned against their prolonged application with compliance in mind. It has also found limited impact of targeted inter-district (effectively longer distance) movement restrictions but recommends further investigation into the consequences of intra-district movement (shorter distance) movement restrictions. The thesis concludes with a discussion on the implications of the findings for public health policy in an LMIC context and identifies directions for future work.

## Chapters

The code is organised by chapters to which they pertain. The chapters of the PhD are as follows: 

1. Introduction
2. People - Who mixes most and why?
3. Movement - What are the characteristics of people and places with higher mobility?
4. Places - The nature of relationships, movers and places
5. Protecs - The Agent Based Model
6. Scenarios
7. Discussion

The chapters with data visualizations are 2,3,4,5 and 6.
